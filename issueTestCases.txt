Task 1:
Working cases: starring/unstarring messages moved anywhere offline so long as it happens in the LIST VIEW
Failing cases: starring/unstarring messages moved anywhere offline, but the action is performed in MESSAGE VIEW
- Move to spam, then star/unstar
- Move to drafts, then star/unstar
- Move to outbox, then star/unstar
- Move to archive, then star/unstar
- Move to arbitrary folder (e.g. "Important"), then star/unstar


Task 2:
No working cases
Failing cases: any "ghost folders" existing in the app but NOT on the IMAP server will allow a user to move a message into the folder but not out of the folder (both online and offline)
Test cases (for move, copy, archive, spam, move to drafts, move to outbox, move to arbitrary folder):

-- ONLINE --
- Move/copy message into a ghost folder from List View
- Move/copy message into a ghost folder from Message View
  - In both cases, message list should get refreshed before prompting user for target folder, and the app will not allow the user to complete the operation (folder no longer exists)

-- OFFLINE --
- Move/copy message into ghost folder from List View
- Move/copy message into ghost folder from Message View
  - In each case, pop-up should appear prompting user to cancel the operation, proceed anyways, or to not show the pop-up again and to proceed
    - If "don't show again" is selected, the pop-up should not appear if a user closes, reopens the app and repeats behavior (i.e. memory between sessions)
